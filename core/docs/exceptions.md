* [NoCachedInstancesAvailableException](../src/main/java/com/bazaarvoice/ostrich/exceptions/NoCachedInstancesAvailableException.java) an exception to be thrown when a service cache does not have an idle cached instance for an end point, it does not have room to create a new one, and it is configured to fail when exhausted.
* [NoSuitableHostsException](../src/main/java/com/bazaarvoice/ostrich/exceptions/NoSuitableHostsException.java) an exception indicating that [load balancing algorithm](../src/main/java/com/bazaarvoice/ostrich/LoadBalanceAlgorithm.java) did not chose any end point from provided end points.
* [OnlyBadHostsException](../src/main/java/com/bazaarvoice/ostrich/exceptions/OnlyBadHostsException.java) an exception to be thrown when all available end points for service have been marked as bad (includes end points that have thrown exceptions during execution or end points that have a failed health check).
